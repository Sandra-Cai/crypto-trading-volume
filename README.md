## Background Tasking (Celery)

The platform uses Celery with Redis for background jobs such as periodic data refresh and alerting.

### Running with Docker Compose

Docker Compose will automatically start Redis and a Celery worker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Usage

1. Start Redis:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7
   ```
2. Start the Celery worker:
   ```bash
   CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0 celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
   ```
3. (Optional) Start the Celery beat scheduler for periodic jobs:
   ```bash
   celery -A tasks beat --loglevel=info
   ```

### What does it do?
- Every 10 minutes, trending coins and their volumes are refreshed in the background (see `tasks.py`).
- You can add more background jobs for alerting, analytics, etc.

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
The application is containerized and ready for deployment:

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t crypto-trading-volume .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name crypto-app crypto-trading-volume
```

### Cloud Deployment
The application can be deployed to various cloud platforms:

#### Heroku
1. Create a `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: python web_dashboard.py
   ```
2. Deploy using Heroku CLI or GitHub integration

#### AWS/GCP/Azure
- Use the provided Dockerfile with container services
- Set environment variables for production settings
- Configure load balancers and auto-scaling as needed

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production` for production deployment
- `FLASK_APP`: Set to `web_dashboard.py` (default)

### Security Notes
- Change the default username/password in `web_dashboard.py` for production
- Use a strong secret key for Flask sessions
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration

## API Rate Limits
The application includes caching to handle API rate limits:
- CoinGecko: 50 calls/minute
- Binance: 1200 requests/minute
- Coinbase: 3 requests/second
- Kraken: 15 requests/10 seconds
- KuCoin: 1800 requests/minute
- OKX: 20 requests/2 seconds
- Bybit: 120 requests/minute

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Errors**: Check your internet connection and API availability
2. **Port Already in Use**: Change the port in docker-compose.yml or use a different port
3. **Login Issues**: Default credentials are `user`/`pass` - change these for production

### Logs
```bash
# Docker logs
docker-compose logs crypto-trading-volume

# Manual installation logs
# Check console output for error messages
```

## Email Alerts Setup

To enable real email delivery for alerts and summaries, set the following environment variables:

- `SMTP_HOST` â€” SMTP server hostname (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- `SMTP_PORT` â€” SMTP server port (usually 587)
- `SMTP_USER` â€” SMTP username (your email address or SMTP user)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` â€” SMTP password or app password
- `SMTP_FROM` â€” (optional) From address for emails (defaults to SMTP_USER)

Example (in your shell or Docker Compose):
```sh
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USER=your@email.com
export SMTP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export SMTP_FROM=alerts@yourdomain.com
```

If these are not set, emails will not be sent (but will be logged to the console for testing).
